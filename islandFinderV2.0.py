def island_finder(threshold, minislandsize, matrix):
    """
    Finds contiguous regions (or "islands") in a matrix where all values in the island 
    are greater than a threshold (but not necessarily the same).
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : int or float
        matrix elements must be greater than this value to be a part of
        an island
    minislandsize : int or float
        min number of connecting (either top, bottom, left or right)
        island elements to constitute an island
    matrix : np.array or some other matrix
        input matrix of arbitrary size

    Returns
    -------
    ans : matrix
    a matrix of same size as input matrix of booleans with islands represented
    by 1's and everything else represented by 0's
